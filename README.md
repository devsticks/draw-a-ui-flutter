# draw-a-ui-flutter

A minimal fork of @SawyerHood's fantastic [draw-a-ui](https://github.com/SawyerHood/draw-a-ui), this is an app that uses tldraw and the gpt-4-vision api to generate Flutter code based on a wireframe you draw.

![A demo of the app](./demo.gif)

This works by just taking the current canvas SVG, converting it to a PNG, and sending that png to gpt-4-vision with instructions to return a single dart file.

> Disclaimer: This is a demo and is not intended for production use. It doesn't have any auth so you will go broke if you deploy it.

## Getting Started

This is a Next.js app. To get started run the following commands in the root directory of the project. You will need an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4 Vision API.

> Note this uses Next.js 14 and requires a version of `node` greater than 18.17. [Read more here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/version-14).

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
